    Hi Kaycee Goodmorning/Afternoon/Evening, may i have some of your time and read this?
  </h1>
  <h1>
    Sorry if I hurt you in my way of distancing.
    It's just because I can't bear the pain anymore.
    Wish u know that my heart is bleeding again,
    I'm a human too na nasasaktan din ng sobra,
    hindi ako manhid para 'di masaktan sa mga 'yon
    mahal rin kita kaya nag seselos ako sakanya.
    but it's always the "selos ka lang" not the "okay ka lang?"
    sobrang sakit non kaycee at ng nararamdam ko ngayon kaycee, SOBRA SOBRA yung SAKIT.
    I just wish that he'll treat you the same way i did.
  </h1>
  <h1>
    I'm distancing my self for my own good din naman
    because I can't bear the pain anymore.
    It's always the 'hes just my friend' and in the end
    ako nanaman yung maiiwan and sila yung magkakatuluyan.
    I don't wanna feel that pain again back then.
    I just wan't to be loved without begging for it,
    but here i am, I'M BEGGING AGAIN.
    I'm SO DONE BEGGING TO YOU TO LOVE ME THE WAY I LOVE YOU.
    I'M SO DONE IN MY LIFE.
    MY HEART IS BLEEDING AGAIN KAYCEE, YOU UNDERSTAND?
    FCUKKKK I HATE MY LIFE.
  </h1>
  <h1>
    tsaka nalang natin ituloy yung love story nating dalawa
    kapag ready kana sa commitment ko, at yung
    kaya mo nadin akong ipriority, pati narin yung
    isa lang yung ineentertain mo na lalake. FS: I'M NOT ACUSING U OF ANYTHING,
    I'M JUST MAKING IT CLEAR that it's hurting me while u we're
    entertaining another boys. 
    I know that you said back then na ineentertain mo sila
    pero 'di tulad ng sakin, pero masakit padin kaycee.
    fucking god knows how much i love you, but you're pushing me away kaycee.
    I really wanted you to be last my kaycee.
    i gave you everything, i gave you my pure love over lust,
    i gave you my loyalty, i gave you all of my time, i gave you the "you're the only only one i'll talk to"
    but did i even deserve to be hurted so much in this way?
    I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED KAYCEE, I JUST WANT...
    <h1>
    I'm so sorry kaycee, I'll wait for you in the end of the river, I'll wait there okay? I'll always love you.
    </h1>
